film <- FilmData

# 1. Does a film's rating (PG, PG-13, or R) impact its cost to produce?
# 2. Does a film's rating (PG, PG-13, or R) influence its IMDB score?

# Show how many films are in each group
table(film$Rating)

#Question 1

# Calculate avg film budget of each group
aggregate(Budget~Rating,film,mean)

# Calculate sd of film budget within each group
aggregate(Budget~Rating,film,sd)

# Visualize the group means and variability
boxplot(film$Budget~film$Rating, main= "Film Budgets by Rating",
        ylab= "Budget", xlab= "MPAA Rating")

# Run ANOVA
modelbud <- aov(film$Budget~film$Rating)
summary(modelbud)

# Run post-hoc test if F statistic is significant
TukeyHSD(modelbud)

#Question 2

# Calculate avg IMDB score of each group
aggregate(IMDB~Rating,film,mean)

#Calculate sd of IMDB scores within each group
aggregate(IMDB~Rating,film,sd)

# Visualize the group means and variability
boxplot(film$IMDB~film$Rating, main= "IMDB Scores by Rating",
        ylab= "IMDB Score", xlab= "MPAA Rating")

# Run ANOVA
modelscore <- aov(film$IMDB~film$Rating)
summary(modelscore)

# Run post-hod text if F statistic is significant
